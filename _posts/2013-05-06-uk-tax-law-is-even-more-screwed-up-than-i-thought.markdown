title:
    UK tax law is even more screwed up than I thought (or, why I will not be
    voting Conservative for the foreseeable future)

I don't often watch Newsnight, but I did a week ago on Friday. I was
sufficiently outraged that I needed to vent on the Internet a little bit.

I was already aware that there are some obvious problems with the UK tax code
-- for example, it's over 11,000 pages long, and so complex that the only
people who seem to understand it are those whose job it is to do so.

However, I wasn't truly aware of how screwed up the whole situation is. The
four big accountancy firms (Deloitte, Ernst and Young, KPMG, and PwC) [second
staff to the treasury] to help them draft the tax laws. Then, after these
secondments are over, they come back to the firms with inside knowledge, and
charge big businesses large amounts of money in order to advise them on the
best ways to reduce the amount of tax they pay.

Let's assume I am creating tax laws, charging businesses for tax advice, and
also that I have little to no moral compass. What should I do, in order to make
as much money as possible?

* To ensure that big businesses continue to pay me to advise them, I need to
  make the law as complex as possible; if other accountants or (heaven forbid)
  ordinary people are able to understand it, they might be able to undercut me
  on price!
* To maximise my value to these businesses, I should make large loopholes in
  the law. The more money they can save as a result of having taken my advice,
  the more I can justify charging for it.

So except for the firms giving the advice, and the big businesses which they
are advising, **everybody in the country loses**. The massively complex laws
mean that no small business is able to operate without the expertise of an
expensive accountant. Ordinary people, unable to afford the advice necessary to
make use of loopholes, must pay the full rate. Public services suffer due to
increasing numbers of cuts. Meanwhile, the accountants are paid absurd salaries
for work which does nothing to help the UK economy as a whole.

Is this really happening? Margaret Hodge is an MP who thinks something ought to
be done about it. There's a video of her being interviewed in the article I
linked to above. She had this to say:

> \[There are\] 9,000 people working in the UK alone. They earn 2 billion
> pounds from this industry, and if you look at what they earn globally,
> because they've got people in the British Virgin Isles, and the Bahamas, and
> everywhere else...

(She smiles at this point, presumably in simultaneous awe and disgust at the
sophistication of this whole setup)

> ...it's worth well over 20 billion pounds.
>
> \[...\]
>
> It came out with KPMG; they had put somebody into the treasury, to help
> advise on how to write the law for a new tax relief. This was a tax relief to
> encourage businesses who invented new products to commercialise them. It was

> Box&mdash;what's in it for you?', then sold it to KPMG's clients as a tax

I probably could have just about coped with all this if it weren't for the
utterly indefensible attitude of the politicians who are supposed to stop
situations like this from arising. In the words of a Conservative MP
(annoyingly, I can't remember his name) who was interviewed on the
aforementioned Newsnight episode:

> I think that it's a healthy state of affairs...it's a good thing that some of
> our brightest and best get to see the public sector in action.

He's not the only one, though. David Gauke, another Conservative MP and the
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, is reported (also in the article I linked
to above) to have said:

> I don't see there's a conflict of interest there.

I'm struggling to get my head around these statements.

Do they have an ulterior motive? Are they being encouraged by the businesses
which enjoy the ability to avoid tax not to do anything about it? Or are they
just intensely stupid? Either way, the question remains: Why is it that these
people are running the country, when it is so abundantly clear that they should
not be doing so?
