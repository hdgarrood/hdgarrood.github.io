title: On fetishisation of STEM subjects

Something I'd really like to see in politics is someone making the case for
studying the humanities. For far too long we have allowed politicians to
fetishise STEM at the expense of everything else. Now our (UK) democracy is at
risk â€” tabloids labelling judges properly doing their job of interpreting the
law as 'enemies of the people', the conservatives casually proposing
authoritarian regulation of the internet in their manifesto, and any artist
making a vaguely political statement on twitter being inundated by morons
asking them to 'stick to music, not politics'.

Surely a big part of the antidote is a greater focus on teaching and studying
history, philosophy, music, and politics?
