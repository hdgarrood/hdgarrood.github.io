Have you ever struggled to understand the Pokémon type efectiveness chart type effectiveness information?

Yeah, me too.
I have always thought that there ought to be a better way of laying this information out, so I had a go myself.
I've been meaning to do this for years, and I just got around to making it over the weekend.

Instead of trying to show you all of the information at once, you just pick one type that you're interested in at a time, and then you can see its effectiveness when attacking or defending.
The page is also responsive, so it should be much easier to use on a phone.

Take a look and let me know what you think: [Pokémon type chart](/typechart)
