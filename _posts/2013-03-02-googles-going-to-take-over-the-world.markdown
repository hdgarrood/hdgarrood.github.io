title: Oh no, it's another 'Google's going to take over the world' post
---

I recently read a book called _Stasiland_ by Anna Funder. It's a collection of
stories from people who lived in communist East Germany, before the Berlin Wall
came down, intermingled with the author's own experiences whilst obtaining
them.  (Well worth a read.) A quotation from it seemed to be a good way to
start this post:

I'm beginning to fear that East Germany will not be able to hold on to that
title for very much longer. Assuming it hasn't lost it already, of course.

It's [Google Glass] which has triggered this thought.

Let's assume that Google is trying obtain as much information about us as it
possibly can. Let's also assume that they're not afraid to abuse their position
as hardware manufacturers (for example, by having their devices record video
and upload it to their servers without being asked). Neither of these seem like
totally unreasonable assumptions to me, given the [Street View wifi scandal] as
well as the attitude of Google's Executive Chairman, Eric Schmidt:

So what's so noteworthy about the Glass? It's certainly true that all the
necessary hardware for 1984-level surveillance already pervades our society in
the form of smartphones. The number of internet-connected devices with cameras,
microphones, and GPSes floating around is certainly staggering.

The difference is that **they're attached to the user's face.**

Smartphones spend most of their time in the user's pocket; clearly there's no
scope for videoing. Additionally the audio will probably be sufficiently
muffled to ensure that it's useless too. Neither of these is the case with
Google Glass; in fact, the human tendency to look at interesting or important
things means that we'd actively be _helping_ Google in their quest to know
everything. Every Glass user would be a free, highly trained, relevancy engine
in the form of an unsuspecting human being.

This isn't the first time Google has outsourced a computationally difficult
task to unsuspecting users. Every image tagging in Google Plus makes their
facial recognition algorithms slightly cleverer, and every command spoken to an
Android phone trains their speech recognition (both for recognising arbitrary
words, and for identifying people by their voices).

What's really terrifying is the prospect of what could be done when all three
of these things (that is, audio and video recordings from everywhere, face
recognition, and text-to-speech) are put together. Mark Hurst explains
it in [his blog post] better than I could:

It took the Stasi 30 years, and 97,000 employees, to create their 180km long
line of files. Once the Glass enters the shops, I wonder what the equivalent
statistic would be for Google?
