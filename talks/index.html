<h1>Talks</h1>

<p>
These slides might not be particularly useful on their own unfortunately, but
here they are anyway. (Maybe if you ask me nicely I'll come to your meetup and
perform one of them.)
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="/talks/2015-lambdaheads-aff">Dealing with asynchronous-ness in PureScript</a>
</h2>
<p>
  I gave this talk to Lambdaheads Vienna in 2015. It's an introduction to
  the Aff monad in PureScript: a library which makes asynchronous code
  really nice to work with.
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="/talks/2015-londonhaskell-pursuit">Enhancing PureScript's Pursuit</a>
</h2>
<p>
  I gave this talk to London Haskell in 2015, while I was working on Pursuit
  for my Google Summer of Code project. It discusses my progress on the
  project and the implementation strategy.
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="/talks/2018-down-with-show">Down with Show!</a>
</h2>
<p>
  I wrote this talk at the end of 2018 as part of Lumi's hiring process. It
  discusses what the responsibility of the Show type class in Haskell and
  PureScript should be, and whether we can do better (I'd argue: yes).
</p>
