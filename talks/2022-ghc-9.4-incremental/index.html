          <h2>Easy incremental CI builds with GHC 9.4</h2>
          <p>Harry Garrood</p>

          <!--
            Hi, and thank you for coming to my talk. I'm going to tell you about
            how I significantly sped up our Haskell CI builds at Mercury and how
            you can probably do the same.
          -->

        <section>
          <p>We spend a huge amount of time recompiling the same code in CI over and over again.</p>
          <p class=fragment>What if we stopped doing that?</p>
          <!--
            This has probably occurred to some of you before. We spend a
            huge amount of time recompiling the same code in CI over and
            over again.

            Why should I have to wait for 3000 modules to compile in CI
            when my changes only affect 10 of those modules?

            How much time and energy have we cumulatively been wasted due
            to unnecessary recompiles? To me, it's almost an embarrassment
            that we collectively put up with this.
          -->
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Ok, well, let's just cache our build products.</p>
          <p class=fragment>Wait, everything is still getting rebuilt. What?</p>
          <!--
            So the next thing you might think is, okay, well GHC already
            has a perfectly good incremental build system built-in right?
            GHC does indeed have a very impressive incremental build system
            built in - in addition to preventing unnecessary recompiles, it
            also implements "cutoff", where if a module's interface hasn't
            changed, then downstream modules won't be rebuilt. It's
            actually really good and I think it deserves more credit. You
            probably take advantage of this locally all the time when
            you're working on Haskell projects.

            Ok great - so, if we want incremental builds in CI, let's just
            keep our build products around, like we do locally, and see
            what happens.
