Stuff I made
------------

* [Multiplayer Pacman][]

  A multiplayer version of the classic Pacman game. The server and the client
  were both written in PureScript, a Haskell-like language which compiles to
  JavaScript. Play the game at <https://mpac.herokuapp.com/>.

* [Redmine release notes plugin][]

  A plugin for the open-source bug tracking and project management system,
  Redmine.

* [King of the Network][]

  The winning entry to the Edinburgh University GameDevSoc Game Jam 2013. The
  theme was 'networks'.

* [Down the Rabbit Hole][]

  Won joint 1st place in the Edinburgh University Functional Programming
  Competition in 2013. It is a zoom sequence of the Mandelbrot set, written
  in Haskell.

* [klasma][]

  A program for composing chiptune music. Reads a text file containing a
  description of a track in a purpose-built domain specific language, and
  turns it into music.

* [Tank game][]

  Just a little game I put together in JavaScript. It runs in the browser.
