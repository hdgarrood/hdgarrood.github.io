## Stuff I made

### Pursuit

* [visit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/)
* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/purescript/pursuit)

A documentation hosting and code search service for PureScript libraries.
Originally my Google Summer of Code 2015 project, it has continued to evolve
since then, and has now received contributions from quite a few other
PureScripters. It is now an indispensable tool for both beginner and more
advanced PureScript practitioners.

### A guide to the PureScript numeric hierarchy

* [read on ReadTheDocs](https://a-guide-to-the-purescript-numeric-hierarchy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A text I wrote in order to explain some of the mathematics behind the
PureScript numeric hierarchy &mdash; that is, the hierarchy consisting of the
type classes `Semiring`, `Ring`, `Field`, etc. The mathematical concepts of
rings and fields come from abstract algebra and are usually not encountered
until undergraduate level, which means that PureScript users without this
background knowledge might find them a little arcane at first. I wrote this
text to share some of my knowledge and hopefully demystify these ideas, since
they are the basis of some of the most commonly used `Prelude` type classes.

### Multiplayer Pacman

* [play](https://mpac.herokuapp.com/)
* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/multipac)

A multiplayer version of the classic Pacman game. The server and the client
were both written in PureScript. To play, you'll need to find at least one
other person to play against; just send them to the same URL.

### purescript-sequences

* [announcement blog post](/blog/announcing-purescript-sequences)
* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/purescript-sequences)

An efficient, general-purpose sequence type for PureScript. This library offers
a data structure designed for use in PureScript code, in order to take
advantage of immutability: giving benefits related to both time complexity of
operations and memory churn.

### solitaire

* [play](./solitaire/)
* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/solitaire)

A simple Solitaire game, writen in PureScript, a Haskell-like language which
compiles to PureScript.

### Redmine release notes plugin

* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/redmine_release_notes)

A plugin for the open-source bug tracking and project management system,
Redmine.

### King of the Network

* [download .EXE](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2TmqHg3DPXLblUtbUh4bmE4cVk/edit)

The winning entry to the Edinburgh University GameDevSoc Game Jam 2013. The
theme was 'networks'. We used GameMaker, so there's only an EXE file. It seems
to work well under Wine though.

### Down the Rabbit Hole

* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/inf1-fp-competition)

Won joint 1st place in the Edinburgh University Functional Programming
Competition in 2013. It is a zoom sequence of the Mandelbrot set, written
in Haskell.

### klasma

* [source on GitHub](https://github.com/hdgarrood/klasma)

A program for composing chiptune music. Reads a text file containing a
description of a track in a purpose-built domain specific language, and turns
it into music.

### Tank game

* [play](./tank-game)

Just a little game I put together in JavaScript. It runs in the browser.
