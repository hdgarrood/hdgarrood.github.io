              Halarose's main product is a large (800 thousand lines of code)
              and complex piece of software which is used by local authorities
              for managing sensitive electoral data. I mainly worked on its
              development team. This included designing and adding features,
              fixing bugs, and refactoring. I also took responsibility for the
              migration to, and continued use of, a new bug tracking system
              (Redmine). This involved creating an automated self-verifying
              backup system as well as a plugin which enabled storage of
              release notes alongside individual issues.  The plugin is now
              open-source and used by a number of other organisations.
              Additionally, I created a web interface to the company's customer
              database, and provided some customer-facing technical support.
