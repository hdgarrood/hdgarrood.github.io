title: On unethical Facebook experiments
---

A few thoughts on the recent furore regarding psychological experiments on
Facebook users, where the subjects were not aware that they were being
experimented on.

### Should we 'expect' Facebook to behave ethically?

It's worth noting that there are two subtly different definitions of the word
*expect*: to expect something can be to consider it likely: "We expect to make
a net gain from this event", but also to consider it reasonable; to seek
it with some (often moral) justification: "Attendees are expected to abide by
the code of conduct."

I agree that we should not consider it likely for Facebook to behave ethically.
However I think we *should* hold Facebook up to a high moral standard. If we
simply shrug, say "that's just how it is," and allow them to continue, then we
deserve everything we get.

Now that that is out of the way:

### Are these experiments surprising?

No&mdash;given Facebook's track record, it is clear that they do not care about
their users. Facebook's history is full of episodes of neglecting to respect
your privacy as a user: tracking you all over the web, [constant assault on
your ability to keep your information private][], and mobile apps requiring a
ridiculous level of access to your phone (such as getting your contact list,
reading your SMS messages, or turning on your microphone or camera at any time
without confirmation). There's also the fact that algorithms rather than people
often decide whether users have broken the community standards and should be
blocked (these algorithms, needless to say, are hopelessly inadequate), and a
completely unbalanced approach to removing inappropriate content (breastfeeding
pictures are deemed unacceptable, while hate groups dedicated to praising
murderers are not).

### Does that make these revelations insignificant?

Of course not! Something about these experiments has upset a lot of people,
regardless of whether it would have done had they all been behaving perfectly
rationally. Reminder: behaving perfectly rationally is **not something humans
tend to do**.

It's true that now does seem an odd time to start being bothered about Facebook
manipulating news feeds; the xkcd comic points out the cognitive inconsistency
that many people have been guilty of (including me). But it's far more
interesting and useful to look at the issues that have been raised:

* What level of control over our emotions does Facebook have? What about other
  aspects of our behaviour? What about our ability to communicate with friends?
* What can we expect them to do, or not to do, with this control? Do we trust
  them with it?
* How do our priorities interact (or conflict) with theirs?

Here's some potential situations to think about.

Facebook could very well make an informed estimate of the political views of
large numbers of users based on the statuses they post, and the things they
like and comment on. Combine this with the fact that a recent feature allows
users to indicate to their friends that they have voted, in addition to showing
users that have not yet voted where their nearest polling stations are, and
that this feature, in the past, has increased turnout enough to sway an
election. Suppose that Facebook had some interest in the outcome of an election.
It seems very feasible for them to [manipulate it][].

Suppose, now, that some government has done a number of things that have
greatly upset their electorate. Large protests are being planned, which makes
this government uncomfortable. It certainly seems plausible that Facebook could
identify people who are the most likely to persuade others to participate in
protest action. Suppose this government approached Facebook and demanded that
they manipulate these people. How could they do this? Might they boost posts
that promote a sense of hopelessness? Might posts calling people to action be
quietly tucked away by the mysterious and opaque news feed algorithm?  Might
accounts be banned based on spurious evidence?

I think it's important to point out that regardless of whether Facebook *might*
do these things, being in *a position where it is possible for them to do so*
is not acceptable. We must not allow Facebook (or any other party) to have this
level of control over our lives. Facebook is [too important][] to be owned by
Facebook.

Facebook (and all the other companies whose business model is corporate
surveillance) tell us that we don't have to use their services; if we don't
like the idea of having them mine our data, we can always use other options.
Unfortunately this isn't really the case: having an email address is more or
less mandatory for modern life, and deactivating a Facebook account will
almost certainly mean you miss out on updates (that you are interested in) from
your friends. It's true that you can always switch email providers: however all
the well-known ones (Gmail, Outlook.com, Yahoo, iCloud) are all pretty much the
same in this respect, and whenever you *send* an email to someone who uses one
of these four, you remain a target of corporate surveillance. What proportion
of your contacts do you think use one of these four services? 95%? 99%?

### Final thoughts

It all looks rather bleak. Thankfully there are some very capable people
working on this problem:

* [Indie Phone][]'s goal is to empower people to own their own data. This
  necessitates a free (libre) and open source operating system for the phone,
  in addition to a server in the cloud to store your data on.
* [sovereign][] is an executable blueprint of a personal cloud server, with
  email, file storage (like Dropbox), contacts and calendars sync, and more.
  Unfortunately, it is only suitable for experienced Linux users at the moment.
* [Cloud Fleet][] looks like a similar idea to sovereign; unfortunately the
  website doesn't give much away.

In the meantime here are some suggestions:

* Watch these talks: [Digital Feudalism and How To Avoid It][], and [Free is a
  Lie][]
* Read these blog posts: [Indie Data][], and [It's the End of the Web As We
  Know
  It][]
* Switch to a free, open source operating system, like Ubuntu. I've been using
  Ubuntu as my main operating system for the last three years and Linux on the
  desktop is pretty solid nowadays.
* Go through your Facebook privacy settings and lock it down, especially for
  Platform and Ads. Better yet, deactivate your Facebook account.
