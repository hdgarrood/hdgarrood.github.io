title: Please Don't Vote UKIP
---

Not a particularly elaborate article: just a list of reasons that we do not
want UKIP running this country, or representing the UK in Europe (or doing
anything at all, really).

You might notice that I didn't comment on whether Britain should remain part of
the EU. I don't think I have the facts in order to form a proper judgement;
however, regardless of how potentially beneficial leaving the EU might be, I am
just trying to show that UKIP is terrible.

I took some inspiration and evidence from this New Statesman article:
[Is Ukip a party of bigots? Let's look at the evidence](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/ukip-party-bigots-lets-look-evidence)

### Racism

During the UKIP party conference in Torquay, Paul Eastwood was hired to give
a stand-up routine. Here are some quotations from The Telegraph's piece on
it ([source](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nigel-farage-defends-foreigner-jokes-at-ukip-party-conference-9165150.html)):

> On the topic of the Olympics, he said: 'Poland did well. They took home
> bronze, silver, gold, lead, copper – anything they could get their hands
> on.'

> Asking if anyone in the crowd was from the Midlands, Mr Eastwood said:
> 'Wonderful! My favourite accent is a Midlands accent,' before attempting an
> impersonation of an Asian person.

This is not humour. This is disgusting and cruel. The insinuations that these
jokes are making is clear: This person thinks Polish people are thieves. He
wishes 'English' people living in the Midlands would stop being displaced by
Asian people.

This is not 'just a joke'; it's really damaging. Jokes like subtly reinforce
racial prejudices and reassure people that they are acceptable. The effect on
our society is severe:

* undercover researchers found that it is [significantly more difficult](http://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/18/racism-discrimination-employment-undercover)
  to get a job if you have an African or Asian name,
* in 2007, black people were [7 times more
  likely](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7069791.stm) to be stopped and searched
  by police than white people,
* in 2009, [just under 27%](http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/ProjectsResearch/Race)
  of prisoners were from an ethnic minority group (the number would be half
  that if it reflected the proportion in the overall population),
* diversity in the Civil Service still shows [pronounced bias against ethnic minorities](http://press.labour.org.uk/post/82083229415/michael-dugher-speech-to-the-ippr-why-britain-needs)
  despite efforts to the contrary.

If UKIP's claim that they are not a racist party&mdash;a claim that they so
frequently and adamantly make to us&mdash;were true, surely they would be aware
of this, and be working to distance themselves from it?

Unfortunately not. Here's Farage's response to Eastwood's routine:

> This was a guy telling jokes about national stereotypes, not racial
> stereotypes. We are heading down a road here where we would kill all humour
> in this country if we tear things to pieces.

He also declined to comment on individual jokes.

There is no meaningful distinction between 'national' and 'racial' stereotypes.

Farage's reaction shows that he simply *does not care* about the safety and
wellbeing of these groups. If he were a decent human being, he would have
attempted to dissociate himself and UKIP from this 'humour,' reassured us that
Paul Eastwood would never be hired for any UKIP event again, and worked to
reverse the damage the routine has caused (for example, by donating to an
anti-racism charity).

### Godfrey Bloom

Godfrey Bloom, heckling a German MEP in the European
Parliament: 'Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer!'
([source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11828319)). This is *fucking
shameful*. Please, go and watch the video at that link.

This is one of the representatives that we, the UK electorate, are sending to
the European Parliament to represent us; this is one of the people we are
putting before Europe in order to help run it.

### ehh

* A tactic that UKIP are often using is the dehumanisation of the Other:

  * UKIP recently announced that it would not be taking action against David
    Challice, the party's Communications Manager, after he suggested that
    'cash-strapped Moslems' should have multiple wives in order to claim more
    benefit, and described Greeks as 'vile'. In response to this, the party
    said:

    > UKIP is not a party that believes in public debate and conversation being
    > stifled by an obsession with political correctness.

    Note that this is an official party statement. The UKIP view is that
    statements like the above actually count as 'public debate' (rather than,
    say, racist slurs).

    ([source](http://news.sky.com/story/1249324/ukip-stands-by-women-stay-at-home-official))

  * Godfrey Bloom described foreign countries receiving aid as 'bongo bongo
    land.' ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/07/godfrey-bloom-regret-bongo-land-ukip))

  * A council candidate for Merton, Andre Lampitt, dismissed Ed Miliband as a
    'Pole' who doesn't know how to run Britain, and said that Enoch Powell was
    right, that Islam is 'Satanic' and that 'Africans should be left to kill
    themselves'
    ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/24/ukip-member-broadcast-suspended-racist-tweets))

  By representing groups of people as weird, or different, or vile, it becomes
  much easier to justify doing such things as stripping them of their homes,
  livelihoods, and rights&mdash;a tactic historically used (to great effect) in
  many cases: Both sides against their enemy in both World Wars; the Communists
  in Russia against the Kulaks (prosperous peasants who were often represented
  as spiders with evil grins, and comically distorted facial features, hoarding
  others' wealth in a web); the Nazis against any of the minority groups they
  targeted.

  I'm not sure if this is even being done intentionally (it's difficult to
  tell). My point is simply to expose this tactic for what it is, and what it
  enables&mdash;namely, the ability to absolve oneself from guilt while
  supporting parties and policies that {DO SOMETHING???}

### Homophobia

* A senior UKIP member, Dr Julia Gasper, on the official party forum, claimed
  not only that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals, but also:

  > As for the links between homosexuality and paedophilia, there is so much
  > evidence that even a full-length book could hardly do justice to the
  > subject.

  Another, Jan Zolyniak, posted:

  > The evidence is quite clear that the percentage of homosexuals who molest
  > children is very high and cannot be dismissed.

  ([source](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ugly-face-ukip-sunday-mirror-1531879))

* The chairman of the youth wing of UKIP, Olly Neville, was harrassed and
  eventually sacked for supporting equal marriage. He said:

  > Ukip were the only party I believed in and trusted, I thought a party that
  > campaigned for democracy and free speech would advocate something similar
  > for its members, especially the youth wing. I feel let down and naive.

### Misogyny

High ranking UKIP members are misogynistic in addition to racist:

> Mr Farage is on record saying females with children are 'worth far less' to
> employers in the financial sector.

> Godfrey Bloom said in an interview [...] that women should not expect
> maternity leave or pay from businesses.

([source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10741121/Nick-Clegg-v-Nigel-Farage-Hey-ladies-Nigel-Farages-Ukip-wants-to-turn-the-clock-back-for-womens-rights.-Fact.html))

Marta Andreasan, a UKIP MEP, said of Farage:

> He doesn't try to involve intelligent professional women in positions of
> responsibility in the party. He thinks women should be in the kitchen or in
> the bedroom.

([source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21355197))

Additionally, here's an excerpt from their website. Unfortunately it's been
taken down from their website, but I took this quotation from
[another article](http://www.ier.org.uk/blog/ukip-workplace):

> An SME which refuses to offer parental leave will either have to offer
> young women higher salaries than other businesses which offer a long leave
> period or they will simply have to recruit from a smaller pool of potential
> employees.

As far as I can see, there are two possible interpretations of UKIP's stance:
the straightforward 'Women should remain in the kitchen or in the bedroom', or
the more nuanced idea that market forces will ensure a good working environment
for women.

The implicit claim is that SMEs which do not offer good employment contracts to
female employees will be less competitive than those that do, and therefore
will lose to those businesses. The result should be that everybody wins.

The problem with this idea is that it just doesn't work like that. Look at the
tech industry, where

### Lies and hypocrisy

### European voting record

### Stupidity

* John Sullivan, the UKIP candidate for the Newent division of
  Gloucestershire's county council, allegedly said on Facebook that physical
  exercise 'releases tension and thus avoids homosexuality' ([source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10027315/Ukip-candidate-PE-prevents-people-becoming-gay.html))

* An ex-member and councillor for Henley-on-Thames, David Silvester, blamed the
  2013 winter floods on same-sex marriage, claiming that Cameron had acted
  'arrogantly against the Gospel' ([source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25802437))
